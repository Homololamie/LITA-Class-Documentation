# LITA-Class-Documentation
This is where I document my first project while learning Data Analysis  With The Incubator Hub

### Project Title: Sales Analysis 

### Project Overview
The Data Analysis Project Aims To Generate Insight into the sales performance of the  company Project over the past year. 
By analysing the various parameters in the data received, I seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable descisions 
which then enable me to tell compelling stories around the data from the insight gotten and to know the best  performance from the data.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
